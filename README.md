The sun had set, and by the dim candlelight of my bedroom, I watched my mother through drooping eyes. She was sitting at the end of my bed, reading from her book of New World fables and folktales — that night, she was reading the old Cherokee myth, where Grandmother Spider steals fire from the Land of the Light and smuggles it into the world.

All too soon, the story was over. ‘Another one,’ I said; and though I pleaded, she refused, for another story would cost her dearly in candle wax. ‘Tomorrow,’ she said wryly, ‘I will read you the frightful story of the Keening Hare, who lives in these very woods’.

As she straightened the folds of her dress and made for the door, I protested  — ‘I don’t want to wait until tomorrow! I want another story!’ She looked back, a flicker of frustration crossing her careworn brow. ‘Then you’ll have to come up with one of your own. Use your imagination’. She snuffed out the candle and closed the door.

When all sounds from the cabin’s main room ceased, I tiptoed from my bedroom to the shelf where we kept the precious few books we had. The book of folktales was nowhere to be found.

Mad with curiosity and unwilling to wait until the next evening, I resolved to seek out the Keening Hare myself. One way or another, I was going to get that story.
